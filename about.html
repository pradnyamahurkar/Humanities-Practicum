					<h2>Our Mission</h2>
					<p>We are a travel organization. We help our clients plan their vacations, business trips, and events. Our office is located in Pune, India, however, we have clients all over the world. Our preference is providing service over phone calls and emails. This creates a unique connection between our clients and us. Clients commend us for our customer service and trust us with their travel plans. We provide our clients services 24/7. Advanced notice is appreciated, however, we are happy to help with last-minute travel plans. We have tie-ups with hotels that give us special discounted rates for our clients. Our mission is to offer our clients the best-discounted rates, options, and personal attention through our agents.</p>
					
					<p>We believe in women's empowerment. The majority of our agents are women. We encourage them to develop skills, gain confidence, and become financially-independent. We have special training sessions for our employees for skill development. BeaconChange's work culture is friendly, motivating, nurturing, and collaborative. </p>
